# CSCI 567 Machine Learning

## Programming Assignment 1

Notebook should work, I have added some statements to print
various distances between points and to test sizes
of input vectors and no. of vectors (kasserts).

F1 score from Wiki page, where a label = 1 is a true positive. (Piazza)

I am unsure about the F1 score for various scaling / distance functions
but confident about the distance functions themselves (please see output
in cell).

(Sorry for late submit!! I did not copy over the last block
of the updated utils.py but did not realize this, and was stuck
with an error.)
